# Jared Randall, PhD Candidate at the University of Alberta

## Spatial Analysis 
As a PhD Candidate in the field of Wildland Fire, I have spent a significant amount of time honing my skills in spatial analysis and statistics in ArcGIS, R and QGIS. I have applied my spatial analysis skills in both academic and industrial settings. 

## Wildfire Behaviour 
My research interests include the impacts of forest management on wildland fire behaviour. My current focus is on how industrial forestry changes fire behaviour at multiple spatial and temporal scales, from firefighting success to large fire spread. In addition to fire behaviour modelling, I have spent time as a wildland firefighter, where I observed fire behaviour in multiple fuel complexes. 
 
## Forest Management 
I am currently pursuing my Registered Professional Forester designation with the Alberta Association of Forest Management Professionals (AAFMP). My research and field work has involved collecting and analyzing forest structure data.

## Statistics 
Ecology has become increasingly quantitative, and the field of wildfire science is inherently spatial. Sophisticated understanding of the integration of ecology and spatial data is inherently necessary for appropriate hypothesis testing.
